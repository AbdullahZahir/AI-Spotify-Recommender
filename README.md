# Spotify-Recommender
The AI Spotify Recommender utilizes KMeans clustering to partition over 114,000 songs into distinct groups based on seven high-dimensional audio features: acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, speechiness, and valence. These features quantify various musical attributes, from the presence of vocals to the emotional tone of a track, enabling the system to generate personalized recommendations by identifying clusters that align with user-inputted favorites. While alternative clustering methods such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering were explored, KMeans was ultimately selected for its computational efficiency, scalability, and superior performance on this dataset. Visual tools like histograms and correlation heatmaps further support feature distribution analysis and enhance the interpretability of the modelâ€™s clustering behavior.
